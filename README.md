# Sortify
A Sorting Visualiser Web Application

Sortify is a web application that provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms. <br/>
It aims to help users understand and visualize the process of sorting data, making it an educational tool for learning and exploring different sorting techniques.
<br/>
# Features :
1. Interactive Visualization - Users can observe how data elements are rearranged and sorted step-by-step through animation-swaps and use of different colours.
<br/>
2. Multiple Sorting Algorithms: The web application supports a variety of popular sorting algorithms, such as : <br/>
   BubbleSort - (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/)  <br/>
   SelectionSort - (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/) <br/>
   InsertionSort - (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/) <br/>
   MergeSort - (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/) <br/>
   QuickSort - (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/) <br/>
<br/>
3. Adjustable Speed and Data Size: Sortify provides adjustable speed controls to control the animation speed of the sorting process.<br/>
Users can slow down or speed up the visualization according to their preference. <br/>
Additionally, users can choose the size of the dataset to sort, allowing them to observe how different algorithms handle different amounts of data.<br/>
<br/>
